## Work/Project Examples
Here is an example of a website I helped create at one of my jobs! http://www.spacedatabase.com/index.html
I was involved in redesigning this corporate website as it looked outdated before, and it was all written in HTML and VB. We were using the C# ASP.NET framework at the time on our web application, so I converted all the VB code into C# and connected it to our database and backend layers so it could more easily integrate with our newer systems.

- I've always been interested in bots and making them as human as possible. Botpress offers developers an API to build and customize their own bots using the power of NLU or natural language understanding. I enjoy how user friendly it seems to use this and how it can easily connect to many popular messaging application such as Slack, Facebook messenger, or Microsoft Teams.

- I love any tool that helps filter teh good emails from the many that we all get every day. This is a tool for system administrators to filter bad emails so they never reach employee inboxes, thus mitigating risks associated with employees not having the proper cybersecurity awareness training to recognize phishing emails, and increasing efficiency.

- I was working on a coding project recently that had me display cards on a screen with a search feature that allowed you to search by names. I wanted to implement a search-as-you-type feature to give the user instant feedback for their search terms and I found this debounce function which helped improve the performance of my feature. Debounce is a function that throttles user input so that you don't end up calling an API endpoint more than is necessary. It does this by waiting for the user to stop typing for a certain amount of time before it makes the API call. This function inspired me by letting me see how simple things like searching as you type can be improved for scalability.

## Focus
I like making computers do complicated work for me. I would love to work on automating a process that is repetitive but simple enough to be done by a computer so it saves a lot of time for developers. For example, at one of my jobs I had to create an invoice report for the accounting department. I created a process that, on Friday mornings, runs a stored procedure from the database and makes the data available for accounting members on an internal company site.
